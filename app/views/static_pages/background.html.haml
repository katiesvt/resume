  %h1 My passion is good code.

  :markdown
    I’ve loved code since as long as I can remember. I started learning the art years before my teens with **DOS** batch files, **Bash** (and variants) shell scripting, **Visual Basic 6.0** and **HTML** and then branching out to **PHP**, **MySQL**, **VB .NET**, and **C#** in high school. In college I also picked up **Scheme** (a variant of Lisp), **Java** and **C++**. In my professional work, I’ve worked with mostly **PHP**, **MySQL**, **Javascript**, **CSS** and **Ruby**. I’ve also worked with quite a few frameworks including **Magento**, **CakePHP**, **Rails**, **jQuery**, and **Wordpress**. I’ve also worked with **SASS**, **SCSS**, **HAML**, **CoffeeScript**, **Grunt.js**, and **Composer**. However, programming is not about language alone - I am intimately familiar with object-oriented concepts including design patterns, multi-threading, scalability, and algorithms: ideologies that apply to any solution. I believe that good code is the same in any language: modular, efficient, and maintainable.
